## <a id="00-00-introduction"></a>[00:00:00] Introduction

**[00:00:00]** You do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol because you are getting older.

**[00:00:04]** You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol because you are living in an evolutionarily inconsistent way

**[00:00:11]** and Western medicine fails to realize this. This is the first hope I've had in 30 years. Check out this review on gut and digestion

**[00:00:19]** from Heart and Soil Supplements from Frances L. She says, I'm two weeks into animal base

**[00:00:24]** with Heart and Soil Supplements and it's difficult to articulate just how excited and relieved I am to have finally found

**[00:00:31]** a healthy lifestyle of eating and movement. An animal-based diet coupled with

**[00:00:35]** Heart and Soil Supplements and gut and digestion has drastically improved the quality of my life.

**[00:00:41]** Overall, inflammation is decreasing. Energy is increasing. Cognition and sleep are improving. As a sufferer of Crohn's disease for almost 30 years, this is the first hope I've had

**[00:00:52]** of existing without discomfort or pharmaceuticals. Thank you, Dr. Paul and the Heart and Soil team.

**[00:00:58]** Please don't stop what you are doing. We will not stop what we are doing. And if you have GI issues, Crohn's, anything, I would recommend checking out an animal-based diet.

**[00:01:08]** You can find all sorts of resources about how to do that at my website, carnivoremd.com, at heartandsoil.co.

**[00:01:15]** You can find gut and digestion from Heart and Soil Supplements, desiccated organs, which include stomach and intestines, which many people with GI issues find to be massively helpful for their conditions.

**[00:01:27]** Our mission at Heart and Soil is to help you reclaim your birthright to optimal health. Find us at heartandsoil.co. We have a whole host of different types

**[00:01:38]** of desiccated organ supplements so you can get more organs in your life and start thriving, get back to your real life. I'm so proud of what they're doing at Heart and Soil.

**[00:01:45]** So proud to be a part of this company. I also want to let you guys know the Kale is Bullshit shirts are live. They are live.

**[00:01:52]** You can go to kaleisbullshit.shop to get Kale is Bullshit shirts to rep the movement.

**[00:01:58]** We also have Sea Oils are Bullshit shirts. We have the Old School Stay Radical shirts.

**[00:02:03]** There's a Carnivore MD shirt. There's all kinds of good stuff there. There's hats, there's a hoodie. We're going to be expanding the merch because I want to see you guys in Whole Foods.

**[00:02:11]** I can't wait till I go to Austin or Miami or somewhere in the United States and I see somebody else wearing a Kale is Bullshit shirt. I'm going to walk up, give you a big fist bump, maybe a hug and buy you a tomahawk.

**[00:02:21]** Can't wait to see how your friends, people in the grocery store react. But the world needs to know Kale is Bullshit, Sea Oils are Bullshit,

**[00:02:28]** you can find it all at kaleisbullshit.shop. On this week's podcast,

**[00:02:33]** I wanted to talk about hypertension. Such a big deal. Millions, 116 million Americans with hypertension. Billions of people in the world with hypertension.

**[00:02:43]** What causes it? How do we reverse it? What about the drugs? Are they useful or not? Are they harmful? What are the side effects? I go into all of that in this week's podcast.

**[00:02:51]** Talk about how medical education is flawed. What we need to do to train doctors better so we can actually improve the health of our population. I know that you guys know someone with hypertension.

**[00:03:00]** Maybe you have hypertension. Maybe you have insulin resistance or you know somebody. Please share this podcast with someone who will benefit.

**[00:03:08]** There is so much to be said about this. It was a really fascinating podcast to dive into. I also want to give a shout out to my sponsors.

**[00:03:15]** They make the podcast possible. I want to start with White Oak Pastures, this sixth generation regenerative farm in Bluffton, Georgia. They've got a new thing going, guys.

**[00:03:23]** You can get 5% off your recurring orders with the code Carnivore5 just for listeners of this podcast.

**[00:03:30]** Carnivore5 gets you 5% off your order there. CarnivoreMD gets you 10% off your order if you are a first-time customer.

**[00:03:38]** And I think you should consider becoming a first-time customer. They have grass-fed, grass-finished beef.

**[00:03:42]** They have lamb. They have Iberico pork. They have soy and corn-free chicken. They have amazing eggs. All kinds of organs. Like I said, it's a regenerative farm.

**[00:03:49]** Will and Jenny Harris are leading the charge in this movement. 120 years.

**[00:03:54]** Six generations in the family. They're good people and this stuff is great. It's how we support the movement. Check them out. WhiteOakPastures.com. Also want to give a shout out to 8sleep.com.

**[00:04:05]** You can go to 8sleep.com. Front slash CarnivoreMD. The podcast is brought to you by 8sleep. You guys know good sleep is the ultimate game changer. I really think that, as I've heard other people say,

**[00:04:16]** if sleep were not something that we have to do every night, it would be banned as the single best performance enhancing substance on the planet. Second only, perhaps, to liver or testicles.

**[00:04:25]** Maybe some intestines and tripe in there. But getting a sleep is crucial.

**[00:04:30]** And more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep. Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep.

**[00:04:36]** Your mattress is probably too hot. That's why I love 8sleep. I got a pod pro cover for my mattress in Austin. This thing is amazing.

**[00:04:43]** Each side cools and heats individually. Your bed partner can have a different temperature than you. It goes as low as 55 or as hot as 110. It has AI in the bed.

**[00:04:52]** Not really, but it does biometric tracking. Does HRV. Tells you all about your sleep. This thing is amazing. Super comfortable. They have the pod pro cover.

**[00:04:59]** They also have the whole mattress. It's the most advanced sleeping technology in the world. I think it's the best way to really cool yourself while you are sleeping.

## <a id="05-07-sponsor-segment"></a>[00:05:07] Sponsor Segment

**[00:05:07]** 8sleep users fall asleep 32% faster. They reduce sleep interruptions by 40%. It's incredible. I mean, I love sleeping on that thing in the States. And when I go to Airbnbs, I hate it because I always sleep too hot.

**[00:05:17]** You can get an 8sleep pod pro. Go to 8sleep.com. That's E-I-G-H-T-S-L-E-E-P.com. Farm slash CarnivoreMD.

**[00:05:25]** Check out the pod pro cover. Save 150 bucks at checkout. They currently ship to the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Also want to give a shout out to another amazing regenerative farm.

**[00:05:37]** PrimalPastures.com. New customers receive 10% off their first order with the code CarnivoreMD. They were founded in 2012.

**[00:05:46]** Sole purpose was to promote better health through diet for themselves and their family. They were fed up with misleading labels found in supermarkets.

**[00:05:54]** They respect nature. None of their food has any antibiotics, hormones, or gross supplements. It's non-GMO, soy-free, certified organic feed in the chickens that receive feed.

**[00:06:03]** The cows are grass-fed and grass-finished. Always pasture-raised. No exceptions. Chickens never have supplemental feed with corn, and they deliver to your doorstep nationwide. They have chicken, pork, beef, lamb, wild-caught fish, raw honey, pastured bone broth.

**[00:06:18]** By the name of coffee, I'm not a fan of that. They mention it here, but they sell it if you like it. If you're thriving, okay.

**[00:06:25]** If you're not, maybe get rid of the coffee. Go to PrimalPastures.com.

**[00:06:29]** New customers receive 10% off the first order with the code CarnivoreMD. Another farm doing amazing regenerative work.

**[00:06:35]** People always ask me, where can I get good meat? PrimalPastures.com. WhiteOakPastures.com. You heard it here on the Fundamental Health Podcast. Last but not least, I want to give a shout out to the friends, folks at HigherDose, D-O-S-E.

**[00:06:49]** HigherDose.com. You can use the promo code Paul at checkout and save 15% off. That's HigherDose.com.

**[00:06:56]** They sent me a PEMF mat, and I love it. It's on the floor of my bedroom.

**[00:07:01]** A pulsed electromagnetic field works by sending electromagnetic waves to your body at different frequencies to help promote your body's own recovery processes.

**[00:07:09]** Did you know that the Earth has like its own EMF field? You can recreate that with a PEMF mat.

**[00:07:14]** You'll feel relaxed, regrounded, rebalanced. They built with a thick layer of 100% natural purple amethyst crystals and mesh fabric across the entire mat.

**[00:07:24]** The smaller mat fits comfortably in an office chair. You can recharge while working. Regular size mat is great for stretching, doing yoga, meditating, chilling, and watching TV. If you have chronic pain, workout frequently, need a moment to relax, lying on the mats,

**[00:07:37]** even a couple minutes a day will help ease your mind and your body from the inside out. I really like this thing.

**[00:07:41]** If you also want a sauna, but you don't want a full room size sauna, they have a sauna blanket, which is pretty cool, an infrared sauna blanket.

**[00:07:49]** Check this out. It has an amethyst layer. It has a tourmaline layer, and it has a charcoal layer. All kinds of crazy stuff.

**[00:07:56]** It's pretty cool in their sauna blankets. So sauna blankets, PEMF mats. Go to higherdose.com to check it out. You can use the promo code Paul at checkout and save 15% off.

**[00:08:16]** On to the podcast. Enjoy this one. Many of you may not have high blood pressure, but I am betting that you know someone who has high blood pressure, whether this is a parent, a grandparent, a brother, a sister,

**[00:08:31]** someone you know likely has high blood pressure. The epidemiology of high blood pressure is astounding.

**[00:08:38]** There are millions, millions of people who have high blood pressure in the world, in the United States.

**[00:08:45]** And I will show you there are really hundreds of millions of people who have high blood pressure even in the United States.

**[00:08:51]** I will show you some graphics that discuss the actual profound burden of this condition in Americans and in the world.

**[00:09:00]** And so in today's podcast, I want to talk about what causes high blood pressure, connections with other medical illnesses like heart disease, otherwise known as atherosclerosis

**[00:09:09]** or kidney disease, and how to reverse it. I'll talk about how Western medicine treats high blood pressure, why I think that that's

**[00:09:17]** actually not addressing the root cause, clearly not addressing the root cause, how we can address the root cause of high blood pressure with medications, though I'm not a fan of

**[00:09:26]** those medications. That will come later in the podcast. And how we can actually address and reverse hypertension with dietary and lifestyle changes. Many of the themes in this podcast will be familiar to regular listeners of Fundamental

**[00:09:39]** Health Podcasts in general, but it's interesting to see how it all ties together. As I've discussed in the past, I don't believe that there are 30,000, I think there's

**[00:09:48]** actually 10,000 diagnoses that medical students are tasked with learning in medical school. I don't believe there are 10,000 illnesses.

**[00:09:55]** I believe there are four or five things that cause the majority of issues for humans. And it's interesting for me to go down the rabbit holes of different conditions like

**[00:10:04]** hypertension or atherosclerosis and often find that the same cause lies at the root of so many of these things.

## <a id="10-12-section-at-00-10-12"></a>[00:10:12] Section at [00:10:12]

**[00:10:12]** So if that is the case, that is something I hope to advance within medicine. That's something I hope to allow more physicians, medical students, nurses, medical educators

**[00:10:20]** to become aware of in my work. When we realize that is the case, we realize we must focus on those root causes in a much more aggressive fashion than Western medicine is today.

**[00:10:31]** So look at the current burden of hypertension. You can see here, this is according to a 2017 paper which looked at NHANES from 2015 to

**[00:10:42]** 2018, and there were 116 million people in the U.S. with hypertension. 47.3% of the population, almost half of the United States population has hypertension.

**[00:10:56]** This is the true pandemic. This is an epidemic.

**[00:11:00]** If you look at how they break this down, this will foreshadow things I'll talk about later in the podcast.

**[00:11:05]** They say, okay, for part of it, for part of this group, lifestyle modifications are recommended. And for part of the group, lifestyle modifications plus medication are recommended.

**[00:11:18]** You can see here, if you go further down this pyramid that I'm showing on the video, all of the people for whom lifestyle modification was recommended remain uncontrolled.

**[00:11:28]** Essentially, all of them remain uncontrolled. The majority of people for whom lifestyle modifications plus medications were recommended still remain uncontrolled.

**[00:11:38]** Some of them become controlled according to the guidelines of what we think of as controlled blood pressure.

**[00:11:42]** Usually, it's 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury. But I find it interesting that basically, according to this graphic that I'm showing,

**[00:11:50]** no one within Western medicine for whom lifestyle modifications are recommended becomes controlled with their hypertension.

**[00:11:56]** We'll talk about why a little later in this podcast. But according to this graphic from the NHANES data, a very small percentage of people who

**[00:12:04]** have hypertension, 47.3% of the U.S. population actually get that under control, or less than 140 over 90, according to these guidelines.

**[00:12:13]** I would say it's even more rare that people get their blood pressure below 120 over 80. But even if they do get their blood pressure that low with medications that I'll talk about

**[00:12:21]** in this podcast, very few of them, if any, are treating the root cause of their hypertension, which will certainly manifest in other problems for them, as you will see later in this podcast.

**[00:12:35]** Here's another paper from Nature Reviews and Nephrology from 2020, talking about the global epidemiology of hypertension.

**[00:12:42]** This is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Hypertension.

**[00:12:47]** Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, the global mean blood pressure has remained constant or decreased slightly over the past four decades.

**[00:12:54]** But the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low and middle-income countries. 31.1% of adults worldwide have hypertension in 2010.

**[00:13:03]** That is 1.39 billion people. These numbers exceed even diabetes, but I will say later, they are connected.

**[00:13:11]** Prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in low and middle-income countries, with 31.5%, 1.04 billion people, than in high-income countries, 28.5%, 349 million people.

**[00:13:25]** So variations in the levels of risk factors for hypertension, such as high sodium intake. So here, in the abstract, they go on to detail what Western medicine considers to be

**[00:13:34]** the risk factors for hypertension. I disagree with these risk factors, and I will talk about what I believe causes

**[00:13:41]** hypertension later in the podcast. But this Nature Reviews and Nephrology article says risk factors include high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity.

**[00:13:51]** I would agree with that one. Alcohol consumption. I would agree with that one. Physical inactivity. Probably agree with that one. Unhealthy diet.

**[00:13:58]** I agree with that. But what I consider to be an unhealthy diet is probably different than the authors of this study.

**[00:14:03]** But they say that those risk factors may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in the hypertension prevalence.

**[00:14:09]** Nevertheless, the point that I am making here is that the burden of hypertension in this country and in the world are enormous.

**[00:14:15]** You know someone with hypertension. Before we get into what we are taught about hypertension in medical school, I want to

**[00:14:22]** share with you guys a distinction that is made in the medical literature regarding hypertension, which is the causes of hypertension, secondary versus primary.

**[00:14:31]** So when we think about hypertension, we are thinking of primarily primary hypertension, something that Western medicine says is age-related.

**[00:14:41]** Western medicine teaches medical students that as people age, for every decade they age, the systolic blood pressure, which is the top number, diastolic number being the

**[00:14:49]** bottom number, the systolic number increases for every decade that people age. Is this true for all humans?

**[00:14:54]** I say no. And I'll show you data to corroborate that in one moment looking at a hunter-gatherer tribe, specifically the Hadza, who I like to talk about.

**[00:15:02]** But Western medicine teaches us doctors, teaches medical students that hypertension happens as we age.

**[00:15:08]** This is primary hypertension. In medicine, we also wrestle with something called secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension is different.

## <a id="15-14-hypertension-discussion"></a>[00:15:14] Hypertension Discussion

**[00:15:14]** I'm not really talking about secondary hypertension in this podcast, but many people do suffer with secondary hypertension.

**[00:15:20]** The numbers are much, much lower than primary hypertension. And the causes of secondary hypertension are things like kidney inflammation at the level

**[00:15:28]** of the glomerulus, the filtering apparatus, called acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal disease, which is chronic kidney disease, polycystic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis.

**[00:15:38]** If the arteries that supply the kidneys or leave from the kidneys become stenotic, that is narrowed, that can cause hypertension.

**[00:15:46]** Inflammation in the arteries supplying the kidneys, renal vasculitis, can produce hypertension. Renin-producing tumors, which are going to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

**[00:15:59]** axis, something that I'll talk about later in this podcast, or aldosterone-producing tumors can also do this.

**[00:16:03]** So then there are endocrine causes of secondary hypertension, adrenocortical hyperfunction, Cushing syndrome, primary aldosteronism, that is a tumor producing aldosterone, which is

**[00:16:14]** also part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, exogenous hormones, glucocorticoids or estrogens, birth control can definitely do this, pheochromocytoma,

**[00:16:25]** which is the tumor that everyone loves to think about in medical school, it's the prime zebra, but it's very rare, acromegaly, which is related to excess production of growth

**[00:16:34]** hormone, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, these have to be very severe abnormalities in the thyroid, or pregnancy can also change blood pressure.

**[00:16:43]** Now, as I said, people with secondary causes of hypertension are much more rare than primary hypertension.

**[00:16:49]** The majority, I would say 97, 98% of what we see in medicine is primary hypertension, but I wanted to point out that secondary hypertension does occur, and there are causes for secondary

**[00:17:01]** hypertension that can be corrected if you remove the tumor, or you correct the endocrine abnormalities.

**[00:17:05]** I remember one time when I was a PA, I worked in cardiology before I went back to medical school, I actually had a patient with severe hypertension, and many doctors had tried to

**[00:17:15]** put him on multiple medications, he was on all kinds of things, minoxidil, second, third line medications for high blood pressure, and this was because no one could get his

**[00:17:24]** blood pressure under control, so I decided to check an aldosterone level on him, and his aldosterone level was through the roof.

**[00:17:30]** He ended up having an aldosterone-secreting tumor in his adrenal gland, so he had primary hyperaldosteronism caused by a tumor in his adrenal gland, and when that was removed,

**[00:17:41]** his blood pressure got significantly better. We later found out that he also had a prolactin-secreting adenoma in his brain, in his pituitary gland, so he probably had some derivative of a multiple endocrine neoplasia, another

**[00:17:54]** zebra thing that medical students like, but this gentleman's blood pressure was never going to get better, no matter what we did, unless we removed the tumor that was secreting

**[00:18:04]** excess aldosterone into his blood. I'll talk about the aldosterone pathway within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade later in this podcast, but essentially, aldosterone is a hormone that works on the kidney to conserve

**[00:18:18]** sodium and causes the excretion of potassium. Now, if your hormones are overacting, and you're conserving tons of sodium, you will

**[00:18:25]** have hypertension, not because of excess sodium in the diet, but simply because you are increasing your absorption of sodium at the level of the kidney.

**[00:18:35]** So let's turn our attention back to primary hypertension. The rest of this podcast will be focused on primary hypertension, because I think of primary

**[00:18:42]** hypertension, colloquial hypertension, as a chronic, reversible illness with diet and lifestyle.

**[00:18:50]** Now, what does the Mayo Clinic say about primary hypertension? I'm showing you this to illustrate what mainstream Western medicine does for this condition.

**[00:18:59]** There is a top number of systolic pressure, a diastolic pressure. They talk about what is hypertension.

**[00:19:04]** Anything over 120 over 80 is really hypertension at this point. You should not have blood pressure of 120 over 80.

**[00:19:12]** And if you look at the Mayo Clinic, they do break this down into primary and secondary hypertension, with secondary hypertension having the potential causes that I mentioned

**[00:19:22]** earlier, though they do add obstructive sleep apnea, which I think is a good thing to be aware of.

**[00:19:26]** But risk factors for primary hypertension, according to the Mayo Clinic, include age. I'll comment on that in a moment.

**[00:19:32]** Race. There is some predilection of certain races to develop hypertension earlier than it does in Caucasians, specifically African-Americans develop hypertension more severely and at

**[00:19:44]** an earlier age than Caucasians. Family history is a risk factor for high blood pressure.

**[00:19:49]** Again, I am going to comment on that in a moment. Being overweight or obese.

**[00:19:54]** Yeah, I would agree with that. Not being physically active, probably, though I think that, as I've spoken about in the past, if you correct your diet and it is evolutionarily appropriate, you will want to be physically

**[00:20:03]** active because you will feel good. Tobacco can do it. Yes. Too much salt in your diet. I disagree with this one. I don't think salt is a root cause of hypertension, though excess salt in the diet can worsen hypertension once you have it.

## <a id="20-16-hypertension-discussion"></a>[00:20:16] Hypertension Discussion

**[00:20:16]** But I'll talk about sodium, why I don't think removing salt corrects the root cause of hypertension later in this podcast.

**[00:20:22]** Too little potassium in your diet. Again, I doubt this is a root cause for many people, though in conditions that I've spoken about later, specifically insulin resistance, that are at the root of hypertension, there

**[00:20:34]** is a hormonal milieu that can lead to excess sodium and lower amounts of potassium in the diet.

**[00:20:39]** People always ask about potassium on a carnivore diet. Something I've spoken about in the past is that meat has a good amount of potassium,

**[00:20:47]** and it's not about how much potassium you get in your diet alone. It's also about how much potassium you retain.

**[00:20:53]** There's plenty of potassium in fruit. Anyone on an animal-based diet, which is what I am more a fan of, will be getting plenty of fruit and plenty of potassium in their diet.

**[00:21:00]** You don't need vegetables to get enough potassium, nor does excess potassium correct hypertension.

**[00:21:05]** You must correct the root cause. Mayo Clinic says drinking too much alcohol. Yes, that can do it. Stress can do it, but it's only temporary, and the blood pressure should return to normal. Certain chronic conditions, they say kidney disease, diabetes, and sleep apnea, those

**[00:21:19]** are really correctable conditions. Those are considered mostly secondary hypertensive conditions. So what about age and family history?

**[00:21:26]** To me, this is really a cop-out within Western medicine. This is the type of thing that we are taught in medical school.

**[00:21:33]** As I said, we are taught that as you age, for every decade that you age, blood pressure increases, systolic blood pressure specifically, and many people will say, I have a family

**[00:21:43]** history of high blood pressure. I was told by my doctor there's nothing I can do. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I believe both.

**[00:00:00]** told by my doctor there's nothing I can do. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I believe both of those are cop-outs by Western medicine. In many people who have a

**[00:00:08]** history of high blood pressure, high blood pressure will develop. But this is not because of the family history. The family history is perhaps a

**[00:00:16]** predisposition that can manifest if these individuals are not living in an evolutionarily consistent way. But a family history of hypertension,

**[00:00:27]** cardiovascular disease, that is atherosclerosis, heart disease, dementia, stroke, cancers, these are not for sure in humans. These are simply

**[00:00:35]** predispositions that we have that are then manifest by the way that we live our lives. Western medicine fails to teach medical students this and all too

**[00:00:44]** often I have heard from patients in the past that there's nothing I can do about my high blood pressure because it's in my family history. There's nothing I can

**[00:00:51]** do about my high cholesterol. I have a family history or I have high cholesterol. I have high blood pressure because I'm getting older. No, no, no. You

**[00:01:00]** do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol because you are getting older. You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol because you are living

**[00:01:08]** in an evolutionarily inconsistent way and Western medicine fails to realize this. And Western medicine fails to counsel patients that this is actually a

**[00:01:17]** correctable, reversible condition. When patients go to their doctors and they are diagnosed with primary hypertension, 99% of the time I believe they are told

**[00:01:27]** there is no cure for this. We don't know what causes it. There is nothing you can do about this. Take this medication. 1% of the time perhaps, maybe 5% of the time

**[00:01:36]** if we're generous, physicians will say cut down on certain foods in your diet. They will often recommend lower salt but as I've mentioned and as I will

**[00:01:43]** elaborate on later in this podcast, that doesn't correct through a cause and it causes more problems for many of these individuals. This paper should be shown

**[00:01:51]** to every single medical student across the United States, across the world. Title is The Physical Activity Patterns and Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease

**[00:01:59]** Risk in Hunter-Gatherers. Herman Ponser is one of the authors on this paper. He was on the podcast previously and they say in the abstract, we found no evidence

**[00:02:08]** of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this population of Hadza hunter-gatherers. There was a low prevalence of hypertension across the

**[00:02:15]** lifespan. Optimal levels for biomarkers of cardiovascular health. I've spoken about this paper in the past when I've illustrated the notion that hunter-

**[00:02:24]** gatherers do not get chronic illness. They do not have risk factors for cardiovascular disease as they age as do people in the Western world but the most

**[00:02:33]** important point I will make about this paper in this podcast is this graphic which shows the systolic blood pressure in men and women and the diastolic blood

**[00:02:42]** pressure in men and women across the lifespan. You can see here that on the x-axis is age in years and it goes up to 80 plus years old. Yes, hunter-gatherers

**[00:02:53]** live long, ripe, vital lives and our notion that they die early is confounded by higher rates of infant mortality in wild human populations and as you can see the

**[00:03:05]** systolic blood pressure does not rise in any significant amount as they age. Even into their eighth decade of life, the average systolic blood pressure was only

**[00:03:14]** slightly above 120 millimeters of mercury for the Hadza hunter-gatherers. Diastolic blood pressure remains between 60 and 80 millimeters of mercury across

**[00:03:24]** the lifespan well into the eighth decade of life for these Hadza hunter-gatherers. There is no age-related increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in

**[00:03:34]** wild living humans, that is hunter-gatherers, the Hadza. I visited the Hadza in February of 2021. I spent time with them. I've spoken about my

**[00:03:42]** experiences there and their diets at length in the past on this podcast. In summary, animals are what they dream about. It is what they think about all

**[00:03:51]** the time. They are hunters. They celebrate meat and organs like nothing else. They don't give a shit about vegetables. They really won't eat vegetables unless

**[00:04:01]** they're starving. They do not eat the baobab seeds unless they're starving. They will eat occasional tubers but they get excited about honey and fruit but

**[00:04:09]** even more so they get excited about meat and organs and they have no seed oils in their diet from their natural state. They are being influenced by local

**[00:04:16]** missionaries who provide them with cornmeal, unfortunately, and some seed oils. So trappings of Western civilization are creeping into their

**[00:04:23]** diets but they are not a significant part of their diet and I believe they were even less a part of their diet when Herman Ponser and his associates did

**[00:04:30]** this research on their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. So systolic and diastolic blood pressure do not rise with age in free-living wild human

**[00:04:41]** populations. This notion should be taught to all medical students as should the notion that free-living humans do not suffer rates of diabetes, obesity, chronic

**[00:04:53]** age-related illness, cardiovascular disease, dementia, or cancer that are even a fraction of what we do in the West. Freedom from all of these things is

**[00:05:01]** completely possible if we align our diet and lifestyle with what our human body is expecting. That's the work that I do. That's how I frame all of the work I

**[00:05:10]** do. Let's return back to the conversation of hypertension. How many patients who go to their doctors receive counseling about dietary and lifestyle changes for

**[00:05:19]** hypertension? I would say very few. Some perhaps. Again, the majority of this is limited to salt restriction which I am not a fan of. Furthermore, we must be

**[00:05:29]** honest with ourselves about the health of our doctors. From a 2007 study, 50% of male physicians in the United States, this is the Physicians Health Study, were

**[00:05:39]** obese and overweight. Those are two different BMI categories that I'm combining. But obesity and overweight were 50% of U.S. male physicians. In the

**[00:05:49]** Nurses Health Study, 39% of nurses were obese and overweight. And we know that in an obese physician and likely in an obese or overweight nurse, counseling

**[00:06:01]** regarding dietary and lifestyle changes will be very different, if present at all. There is good research to corroborate this notion. You can see here a very sad

**[00:06:10]** study that is unfortunately true from 2012. The Impact of Physician Body Mass Index on Obesity Care and Beliefs. This is using a national cross-country survey

**[00:06:21]** of 500 primary care physicians from 2011. We found that physicians with normal BMI were more likely to engage their obese patients in weight loss

**[00:06:30]** discussions as compared to overweight and obese physicians. 30% versus 18% with a p-value of 0.01. Physicians with a normal BMI had greater confidence in

**[00:06:40]** their ability to provide dietary and exercise counseling to their obese patients. A higher percentage of normal BMI physicians believed that overweight

**[00:06:49]** and obese patients would be less likely to trust weight loss advice from overweight and obese doctors. And physicians in the normal BMI category

**[00:06:57]** were more likely to believe that physicians should model healthy weight related behaviors, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly. The

**[00:07:04]** probability of a physician recording an obesity diagnosis or initiating a weight loss conversation with their obese patients was higher when the perception

**[00:07:14]** of the patient's body weight met or exceeded their own personal body weight. And those numbers are substantial. So the probability of a physician recording an

**[00:07:24]** obesity diagnosis was 93% versus 7% and 89% versus 11% for the probability of initiating a weight loss conversation when the obese patient's

**[00:07:38]** body mass index was greater than the physicians. So if the patient was not fatter than the physician, the doctors didn't talk to them about weight loss

**[00:07:48]** and why would they even if the patient was overweight clearly. These results suggest that more normal weight physicians provided recommended obesity

**[00:07:57]** care to their patients and felt confident doing so. Yeah, no surprise there. But interestingly, I have had conversations with many friends from medical school,

**[00:08:07]** from residency, and friends who are currently residents. And this is just my observation, but they will often tell me, dependent on specialties, most of their

**[00:08:17]** colleagues, even in residency, are drinking, they're overweight, they're not eating healthfully. We're not creating a future cadre of physicians who value health.

**[00:08:27]** We're creating physicians who value work, who value money, and who value getting the heck out of the hospital most of the time. So I believe the medical system is

**[00:08:37]** massively broken and statistics suggesting that half of all male physicians are obese and overweight. I can't even imagine how many male

**[00:08:46]** physicians, or female physicians for that matter, have elevated levels of fasting insulin. We are not creating a group of healthy doctors, so how could we be

**[00:08:54]** expected to counsel patients properly regarding the most important things that they can do for their health? Dietary changes, aligning their diet with what is

**[00:09:03]** evolutionarily consistent for humans, and lifestyle changes. Exercising more sunlight, avoidance of toxins in the environment, clean drinking water, etc. So

**[00:09:13]** now that we've talked about the background of hypertension, the differences between primary and secondary hypertension, how Western

**[00:09:21]** medicine thinks about primary hypertension, age-related family history, irreversible, let's talk about how Western medicine addresses hypertension,

**[00:09:30]** mostly medications. Salt restriction is part of it, I'll talk about that in a moment, but the medications that Western medicine uses for hypertension include

**[00:09:39]** angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, diuretics like

**[00:09:49]** thiazides or loop diuretics. I'll talk about the ACE, ARB, and direct renin inhibitors in the context of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which

**[00:09:58]** I'll detail in a moment. But none of those medications correct the root cause of hypertension, which I believe most of medicine agrees on, and we know very

**[00:10:07]** clearly. Do we have a medication that treats the root cause of hypertension? We do, actually. I'm not a fan of using it, and I'll talk about that later in the

**[00:10:14]** podcast. I'm going to keep you guys in suspense for a little bit longer, but that medication doesn't do great things for humans as it's correcting the root

**[00:10:22]** cause, but we have a medication that corrects the root cause of hypertension. I'm not advocating that we use it. I only will bring it up later in the

**[00:10:29]** podcast to illustrate the cause of hypertension, how correcting the cause of hypertension can reverse other issues and be beneficial, and how insulin

**[00:10:40]** resistance can be fixed. So stay tuned for all of that. So what are the side effects of the medications we use to treat hypertension? Well, if you're on a

**[00:10:46]** beta blocker, it's going to slow your pulse. It causes erectile dysfunction. It can cause depression. Calcium channel blockers cause peripheral edema,

**[00:10:54]** worsening of swelling in the limbs, and that can cause orthostasis or lightheadedness when people stand up, leading to falls and orthopedic injuries.

**[00:11:02]** Diuretics, whether they're loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics, cause loss of critical electrolytes for humans and nutrients that are not intended to

**[00:11:10]** be lost. Look at the list of nutrient deficiencies associated with a loop diuretic like Lasix or furosemide. It is long. B vitamins, magnesium, other

**[00:11:19]** minerals, massive deficiencies follow when we cause diuresis in humans to treat hypertension without treating the root cause. Thiazide diuretics can also

**[00:11:29]** cause problems in terms of electrolyte deficiencies and nutrient deficiencies. These are a nightmare for our human long term health. This is the problem with

**[00:11:37]** Western medicine. It's myopic. It looks at a symptom, treats the symptom, and then ignores the side effects of the medication or must use other medications

**[00:11:45]** to treat the side effects of the medication it uses. Why not just treat the root cause? Angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, direct

**[00:11:53]** front end inhibitors, all can cause electrolyte issues. Many of them can cause angioedema. ACE inhibitors specifically cause a dry cough associated

**[00:12:00]** with bradykinin. None of these medications are ideal for humans. No medication that we give to humans is ideal in general. They all have utility.

**[00:12:07]** Have I prescribed all of them in the past? Yes, absolutely. I have. I was once a physician assistant who worked in cardiology, who did not understand the

**[00:12:16]** root cause of hypertension, and so I prescribed all these medications. I have also prescribed statins to patients in the past. Would I do this now? No, I

**[00:12:23]** would strongly counsel patients regarding the root causes of hypertension, which I believe are insulin resistance, and I'll get to that in a moment, and

**[00:12:31]** how to change that. I will definitely talk about that in this podcast. For the sake of completeness, I've spoken about the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

**[00:12:38]** a number of times in this podcast. I will do a little bit of education about what this is. In the liver, there is a substance produced called angiotensinogen

**[00:12:46]** that is converted to angiotensin 1 by a substance called renin, which is produced by the kidneys. Renin will be released from the kidneys if the

**[00:12:56]** kidneys sense that blood pressure is low in a number of ways, at the level of arterioles, at the level of something called the JGA or the juxtaglomerular

**[00:13:05]** apparatus. Angiotensin 1 is converted to a more active form, angiotensin 2, by an enzyme called ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme, found in the

**[00:13:15]** pulmonary and renal endothelium. Angiotensin 2 has many effects on the human body that are necessary for our survival in the setting of massive blood

**[00:13:25]** loss or dehydration, including increasing sympathetic activity. That is the fight
