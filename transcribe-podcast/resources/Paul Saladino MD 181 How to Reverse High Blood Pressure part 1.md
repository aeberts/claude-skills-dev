[00:00:00]

 You do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol

[00:00:03]

 because you are getting older.

[00:00:04]

 You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol

[00:00:07]

 because you are living in an evolutionarily inconsistent way

[00:00:11]

 and Western medicine fails to realize this.

[00:00:13]

 This is the first hope I've had in 30 years.

[00:00:17]

 Check out this review on gut and digestion

[00:00:19]

 from Heart and Soil Supplements from Frances L.

[00:00:22]

 She says, I'm two weeks into animal base

[00:00:24]

 with Heart and Soil Supplements

[00:00:25]

 and it's difficult to articulate just how excited

[00:00:28]

 and relieved I am to have finally found

[00:00:31]

 a healthy lifestyle of eating and movement.

[00:00:34]

 An animal-based diet coupled with

[00:00:35]

 Heart and Soil Supplements and gut and digestion

[00:00:38]

 has drastically improved the quality of my life.

[00:00:41]

 Overall, inflammation is decreasing.

[00:00:43]

 Energy is increasing.

[00:00:44]

 Cognition and sleep are improving.

[00:00:46]

 As a sufferer of Crohn's disease for almost 30 years,

[00:00:50]

 this is the first hope I've had

[00:00:52]

 of existing without discomfort or pharmaceuticals.

[00:00:55]

 Thank you, Dr. Paul and the Heart and Soil team.

[00:00:58]

 Please don't stop what you are doing.

[00:01:00]

 We will not stop what we are doing.

[00:01:02]

 And if you have GI issues, Crohn's, anything,

[00:01:06]

 I would recommend checking out an animal-based diet.

[00:01:08]

 You can find all sorts of resources about how to do that

[00:01:11]

 at my website, carnivoremd.com, at heartandsoil.co.

[00:01:15]

 You can find gut and digestion

[00:01:17]

 from Heart and Soil Supplements, desiccated organs,

[00:01:19]

 which include stomach and intestines,

[00:01:21]

 which many people with GI issues find to be

[00:01:24]

 massively helpful for their conditions.

[00:01:27]

 Our mission at Heart and Soil is to help you

[00:01:29]

 reclaim your birthright to optimal health.

[00:01:43]

 I'm so proud of what they're doing at Heart and Soil.

[00:01:45]

 So proud to be a part of this company.

[00:01:47]

 I also want to let you guys know

[00:01:49]

 There's all kinds of good stuff there.

[00:02:06]

 There's hats, there's a hoodie.

[00:02:07]

 We're going to be expanding the merch

[00:02:09]

 because I want to see you guys in Whole Foods.

[00:02:11]

 I can't wait till I go to Austin or Miami

[00:02:13]

 or somewhere in the United States

[00:02:15]

 and I see somebody else wearing a Kale is Bullshit shirt.

[00:02:17]

 I'm going to walk up, give you a big fist bump,

[00:02:18]

 maybe a hug and buy you a tomahawk.

[00:02:21]

 Can't wait to see how your friends,

[00:02:23]

 people in the grocery store react.

[00:02:24]

 But the world needs to know Kale is Bullshit,

[00:02:27]

 Sea Oils are Bullshit,

[00:02:28]

 you can find it all at kaleisbullshit.shop.

[00:02:32]

 On this week's podcast,

[00:02:33]

 I wanted to talk about hypertension.

[00:02:35]

 Such a big deal.

[00:02:37]

 Millions, 116 million Americans with hypertension.

[00:02:41]

 Billions of people in the world with hypertension.

[00:02:43]

 What causes it?

[00:02:44]

 How do we reverse it?

[00:02:45]

 What about the drugs?

[00:02:46]

 Are they useful or not?

[00:02:47]

 Are they harmful?

[00:02:48]

 What are the side effects?

[00:02:49]

 I go into all of that in this week's podcast.

[00:02:51]

 Talk about how medical education is flawed.

[00:02:53]

 What we need to do to train doctors better

[00:02:55]

 so we can actually improve the health of our population.

[00:02:58]

 I know that you guys know someone with hypertension.

[00:03:00]

 Maybe you have hypertension.

[00:03:02]

 Maybe you have insulin resistance or you know somebody.

[00:03:05]

 Please share this podcast with someone who will benefit.

[00:03:08]

 There is so much to be said about this.

[00:03:09]

 It was a really fascinating podcast to dive into.

[00:03:13]

 I also want to give a shout out to my sponsors.

[00:03:15]

 They make the podcast possible.

[00:03:17]

 I want to start with White Oak Pastures,

[00:03:18]

 this sixth generation regenerative farm in Bluffton, Georgia.

[00:03:22]

 They've got a new thing going, guys.

[00:03:23]

 You can get 5% off your recurring orders with the code Carnivore5

[00:03:28]

 just for listeners of this podcast.

[00:03:30]

 Carnivore5 gets you 5% off your order there.

[00:03:33]

 CarnivoreMD gets you 10% off your order if you are a first-time customer.

[00:03:38]

 And I think you should consider becoming a first-time customer.

[00:03:41]

 They have grass-fed, grass-finished beef.

[00:03:42]

 They have lamb.

[00:03:43]

 They have Iberico pork.

[00:03:44]

 They have soy and corn-free chicken.

[00:03:46]

 They have amazing eggs.

[00:03:47]

 All kinds of organs.

[00:03:48]

 Like I said, it's a regenerative farm.

[00:03:49]

 Will and Jenny Harris are leading the charge in this movement.

[00:03:53]

 120 years.

[00:03:54]

 Six generations in the family.

[00:03:55]

 They're good people and this stuff is great.

[00:03:57]

 It's how we support the movement.

[00:03:58]

 Check them out.

[00:04:02]

 Also want to give a shout out to 8sleep.com.

[00:04:05]

 You can go to 8sleep.com.

[00:04:07]

 Front slash CarnivoreMD.

[00:04:09]

 The podcast is brought to you by 8sleep.

[00:04:10]

 You guys know good sleep is the ultimate game changer.

[00:04:13]

 I really think that, as I've heard other people say,

[00:04:16]

 if sleep were not something that we have to do every night,

[00:04:18]

 it would be banned as the single best performance enhancing substance on the planet.

[00:04:23]

 Second only, perhaps, to liver or testicles.

[00:04:25]

 Maybe some intestines and tripe in there.

[00:04:28]

 But getting a sleep is crucial.

[00:04:30]

 And more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.

[00:04:33]

 Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep.

[00:04:36]

 Your mattress is probably too hot.

[00:04:38]

 That's why I love 8sleep.

[00:04:39]

 I got a pod pro cover for my mattress in Austin.

[00:04:42]

 This thing is amazing.

[00:04:43]

 Each side cools and heats individually.

[00:04:45]

 Your bed partner can have a different temperature than you.

[00:04:47]

 It goes as low as 55 or as hot as 110.

[00:04:50]

 It has AI in the bed.

[00:04:52]

 Not really, but it does biometric tracking.

[00:04:54]

 Does HRV.

[00:04:55]

 Tells you all about your sleep.

[00:04:56]

 This thing is amazing.

[00:04:57]

 Super comfortable.

[00:04:58]

 They have the pod pro cover.

[00:04:59]

 They also have the whole mattress.

[00:05:00]

 It's the most advanced sleeping technology in the world.

[00:05:03]

 I think it's the best way to really cool yourself while you are sleeping.

[00:05:07]

 8sleep users fall asleep 32% faster.

[00:05:09]

 They reduce sleep interruptions by 40%.

[00:05:11]

 It's incredible.

[00:05:12]

 I mean, I love sleeping on that thing in the States.

[00:05:14]

 And when I go to Airbnbs, I hate it because I always sleep too hot.

[00:05:17]

 You can get an 8sleep pod pro.

 Also want to give a shout out to another amazing regenerative farm.

[00:05:37]

 PrimalPastures.com.

[00:05:39]

 New customers receive 10% off their first order with the code CarnivoreMD.

[00:05:44]

 They were founded in 2012.

[00:05:46]

 Sole purpose was to promote better health through diet for themselves and their family.

[00:05:51]

 They were fed up with misleading labels found in supermarkets.

[00:05:54]

 They respect nature.

[00:05:56]

 None of their food has any antibiotics, hormones, or gross supplements.

[00:05:59]

 It's non-GMO, soy-free, certified organic feed in the chickens that receive feed.

[00:06:03]

 The cows are grass-fed and grass-finished.

[00:06:05]

 Always pasture-raised.

[00:06:06]

 No exceptions.

[00:06:07]

 Chickens never have supplemental feed with corn, and they deliver to your doorstep nationwide.

[00:06:13]

 They have chicken, pork, beef, lamb, wild-caught fish, raw honey, pastured bone broth.

[00:06:18]

 By the name of coffee, I'm not a fan of that.

[00:06:20]

 They mention it here, but they sell it if you like it.

[00:06:23]

 If you're thriving, okay.

[00:06:25]

 If you're not, maybe get rid of the coffee.

[00:06:28]

 Go to PrimalPastures.com.

[00:06:29]

 New customers receive 10% off the first order with the code CarnivoreMD.

[00:06:33]

 People always ask me, where can I get good meat?

[00:06:37]

 PrimalPastures.com.

[00:06:39]

 WhiteOakPastures.com.

[00:06:40]

 You heard it here on the Fundamental Health Podcast.

[00:06:43]

 Last but not least, I want to give a shout out to the friends, folks at HigherDose, D-O-S-E.

[00:06:56]

 They sent me a PEMF mat, and I love it.

[00:06:59]

 It's on the floor of my bedroom.

[00:07:01]

 A pulsed electromagnetic field works by sending electromagnetic waves to your body at different

[00:07:06]

 frequencies to help promote your body's own recovery processes.

[00:07:09]

 Did you know that the Earth has like its own EMF field?

[00:07:12]

 You can recreate that with a PEMF mat.

[00:07:14]

 You'll feel relaxed, regrounded, rebalanced.

[00:07:16]

 They built with a thick layer of 100% natural purple amethyst crystals and mesh fabric across

[00:07:23]

 the entire mat.

[00:07:24]

 The smaller mat fits comfortably in an office chair.

[00:07:26]

 You can recharge while working.

[00:07:27]

 Regular size mat is great for stretching, doing yoga, meditating, chilling, and watching TV.

[00:07:32]

 If you have chronic pain, workout frequently, need a moment to relax, lying on the mats,

[00:07:37]

 even a couple minutes a day will help ease your mind and your body from the inside out.

[00:07:40]

 I really like this thing.

[00:07:41]

 If you also want a sauna, but you don't want a full room size sauna, they have a sauna

[00:07:46]

 blanket, which is pretty cool, an infrared sauna blanket.

[00:07:49]

 Check this out.

[00:07:49]

 It has an amethyst layer.

[00:07:51]

 It has a tourmaline layer, and it has a charcoal layer.

[00:07:54]

 All kinds of crazy stuff.

[00:07:56]

 It's pretty cool in their sauna blankets.

[00:07:58]

 So sauna blankets, PEMF mats.

 That is it, my friends.

[00:08:16]

 On to the podcast.

[00:08:18]

 Enjoy this one.

[00:08:19]

 Many of you may not have high blood pressure, but I am betting that you know someone who

[00:08:26]

 has high blood pressure, whether this is a parent, a grandparent, a brother, a sister,

[00:08:31]

 someone you know likely has high blood pressure.

[00:08:34]

 The epidemiology of high blood pressure is astounding.

[00:08:38]

 There are millions, millions of people who have high blood pressure in the world, in

[00:08:44]

 the United States.

[00:08:45]

 And I will show you there are really hundreds of millions of people who have high blood

[00:08:49]

 pressure even in the United States.

[00:08:51]

 I will show you some graphics that discuss the actual profound burden of this condition

[00:08:58]

 in Americans and in the world.

[00:09:00]

 And so in today's podcast, I want to talk about what causes high blood pressure,

[00:09:04]

 connections with other medical illnesses like heart disease, otherwise known as atherosclerosis

[00:09:09]

 or kidney disease, and how to reverse it.

[00:09:13]

 I'll talk about how Western medicine treats high blood pressure, why I think that that's

[00:09:17]

 actually not addressing the root cause, clearly not addressing the root cause, how we can

[00:09:22]

 address the root cause of high blood pressure with medications, though I'm not a fan of

[00:09:26]

 those medications.

[00:09:27]

 That will come later in the podcast.

[00:09:28]

 And how we can actually address and reverse hypertension with dietary and lifestyle changes.

[00:09:34]

 Many of the themes in this podcast will be familiar to regular listeners of Fundamental

[00:09:39]

 Health Podcasts in general, but it's interesting to see how it all ties together.

[00:09:43]

 As I've discussed in the past, I don't believe that there are 30,000, I think there's

[00:09:48]

 actually 10,000 diagnoses that medical students are tasked with learning in medical school.

[00:09:53]

 I don't believe there are 10,000 illnesses.

[00:09:55]

 I believe there are four or five things that cause the majority of issues for humans.

[00:10:00]

 And it's interesting for me to go down the rabbit holes of different conditions like

[00:10:04]

 hypertension or atherosclerosis and often find that the same cause lies at the root

[00:10:11]

 of so many of these things.

[00:10:12]

 So if that is the case, that is something I hope to advance within medicine.

[00:10:16]

 That's something I hope to allow more physicians, medical students, nurses, medical educators

[00:10:20]

 to become aware of in my work.

[00:10:22]

 When we realize that is the case, we realize we must focus on those root causes in a much

[00:10:28]

 more aggressive fashion than Western medicine is today.

[00:10:31]

 So look at the current burden of hypertension.

[00:10:35]

 You can see here, this is according to a 2017 paper which looked at NHANES from 2015 to

[00:10:42]

 2018, and there were 116 million people in the U.S. with hypertension.

[00:10:49]

 47.3% of the population, almost half of the United States population has hypertension.

[00:10:56]

 This is the true pandemic.

[00:10:59]

 This is an epidemic.

[00:11:00]

 If you look at how they break this down, this will foreshadow things I'll talk about later

[00:11:04]

 in the podcast.

[00:11:05]

 They say, okay, for part of it, for part of this group, lifestyle modifications are recommended.

[00:11:12]

 And for part of the group, lifestyle modifications plus medication are recommended.

[00:11:18]

 You can see here, if you go further down this pyramid that I'm showing on the video,

[00:11:22]

 all of the people for whom lifestyle modification was recommended remain uncontrolled.

[00:11:28]

 Essentially, all of them remain uncontrolled.

[00:11:30]

 The majority of people for whom lifestyle modifications plus medications were recommended

[00:11:36]

 still remain uncontrolled.

[00:11:38]

 Some of them become controlled according to the guidelines of what we think of as controlled

[00:11:41]

 blood pressure.

[00:11:42]

 Usually, it's 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury.

[00:11:45]

 But I find it interesting that basically, according to this graphic that I'm showing,

[00:11:50]

 no one within Western medicine for whom lifestyle modifications are recommended becomes controlled

[00:11:55]

 with their hypertension.

[00:11:56]

 We'll talk about why a little later in this podcast.

[00:11:59]

 But according to this graphic from the NHANES data, a very small percentage of people who

[00:12:04]

 have hypertension, 47.3% of the U.S. population actually get that under control, or less than

[00:12:11]

 140 over 90, according to these guidelines.

[00:12:13]

 I would say it's even more rare that people get their blood pressure below 120 over 80.

[00:12:17]

 But even if they do get their blood pressure that low with medications that I'll talk about

[00:12:21]

 in this podcast, very few of them, if any, are treating the root cause of their hypertension,

[00:12:30]

 which will certainly manifest in other problems for them, as you will see later in this podcast.

[00:12:35]

 Here's another paper from Nature Reviews and Nephrology from 2020, talking about the global

[00:12:40]

 epidemiology of hypertension.

[00:12:42]

 This is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide.

[00:12:46]

 Hypertension.

[00:12:47]

 Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, the global mean blood pressure

[00:12:51]

 has remained constant or decreased slightly over the past four decades.

[00:12:54]

 But the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low and middle-income countries.

[00:12:59]

 31.1% of adults worldwide have hypertension in 2010.

[00:13:03]

 That is 1.39 billion people.

[00:13:07]

 These numbers exceed even diabetes, but I will say later, they are connected.

[00:13:11]

 Prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in low and middle-income countries,

[00:13:16]

 with 31.5%, 1.04 billion people, than in high-income countries, 28.5%, 349 million people.

[00:13:25]

 So variations in the levels of risk factors for hypertension, such as high sodium intake.

[00:13:29]

 So here, in the abstract, they go on to detail what Western medicine considers to be

[00:13:34]

 the risk factors for hypertension.

[00:13:37]

 I disagree with these risk factors, and I will talk about what I believe causes

[00:13:41]

 hypertension later in the podcast.

[00:13:42]

 But this Nature Reviews and Nephrology article says risk factors include high sodium intake,

[00:13:49]

 low potassium intake, obesity.

[00:13:51]

 I would agree with that one.

[00:13:52]

 Alcohol consumption.

[00:13:53]

 I would agree with that one.

[00:13:54]

 Physical inactivity.

[00:13:55]

 Probably agree with that one.

[00:13:57]

 Unhealthy diet.

[00:13:58]

 I agree with that.

[00:13:59]

 But what I consider to be an unhealthy diet is probably different than the authors of

[00:14:02]

 this study.

[00:14:03]

 But they say that those risk factors may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in the

[00:14:07]

 hypertension prevalence.

[00:14:09]

 Nevertheless, the point that I am making here is that the burden of hypertension in this

[00:14:13]

 country and in the world are enormous.

[00:14:15]

 You know someone with hypertension.

[00:14:18]

 Before we get into what we are taught about hypertension in medical school, I want to

[00:14:22]

 share with you guys a distinction that is made in the medical literature regarding hypertension,

[00:14:27]

 which is the causes of hypertension, secondary versus primary.

[00:14:31]

 So when we think about hypertension, we are thinking of primarily primary hypertension,

[00:14:37]

 something that Western medicine says is age-related.

[00:14:41]

 Western medicine teaches medical students that as people age, for every decade they

[00:14:44]

 age, the systolic blood pressure, which is the top number, diastolic number being the

[00:14:49]

 bottom number, the systolic number increases for every decade that people age.

[00:14:53]

 Is this true for all humans?

[00:14:54]

 I say no.

[00:14:55]

 And I'll show you data to corroborate that in one moment looking at a hunter-gatherer

[00:14:59]

 tribe, specifically the Hadza, who I like to talk about.

[00:15:02]

 But Western medicine teaches us doctors, teaches medical students that hypertension happens

[00:15:07]

 as we age.

[00:15:08]

 This is primary hypertension.

[00:15:09]

 In medicine, we also wrestle with something called secondary hypertension.

[00:15:13]

 Secondary hypertension is different.

[00:15:14]

 I'm not really talking about secondary hypertension in this podcast, but many people do suffer

[00:15:19]

 with secondary hypertension.

[00:15:20]

 The numbers are much, much lower than primary hypertension.

[00:15:24]

 And the causes of secondary hypertension are things like kidney inflammation at the level

[00:15:28]

 of the glomerulus, the filtering apparatus, called acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal

[00:15:33]

 disease, which is chronic kidney disease, polycystic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis.

[00:15:38]

 If the arteries that supply the kidneys or leave from the kidneys become stenotic, that

[00:15:43]

 is narrowed, that can cause hypertension.

[00:15:46]

 Inflammation in the arteries supplying the kidneys, renal vasculitis, can produce hypertension.

[00:15:53]

 Renin-producing tumors, which are going to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

[00:15:59]

 axis, something that I'll talk about later in this podcast, or aldosterone-producing

[00:16:02]

 tumors can also do this.

[00:16:03]

 So then there are endocrine causes of secondary hypertension, adrenocortical hyperfunction,

[00:16:09]

 Cushing syndrome, primary aldosteronism, that is a tumor producing aldosterone, which is

[00:16:14]

 also part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, exogenous

[00:16:20]

 hormones, glucocorticoids or estrogens, birth control can definitely do this, pheochromocytoma,

[00:16:25]

 which is the tumor that everyone loves to think about in medical school, it's the prime

[00:16:29]

 zebra, but it's very rare, acromegaly, which is related to excess production of growth

[00:16:34]

 hormone, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, these have to be very severe abnormalities in the thyroid,

[00:16:40]

 or pregnancy can also change blood pressure.

[00:16:43]

 Now, as I said, people with secondary causes of hypertension are much more rare than primary

[00:16:48]

 hypertension.

[00:16:49]

 The majority, I would say 97, 98% of what we see in medicine is primary hypertension,

[00:16:55]

 but I wanted to point out that secondary hypertension does occur, and there are causes for secondary

[00:17:01]

 hypertension that can be corrected if you remove the tumor, or you correct the endocrine

[00:17:04]

 abnormalities.

[00:17:05]

 I remember one time when I was a PA, I worked in cardiology before I went back to medical

[00:17:09]

 school, I actually had a patient with severe hypertension, and many doctors had tried to

[00:17:15]

 put him on multiple medications, he was on all kinds of things, minoxidil, second, third

[00:17:20]

 line medications for high blood pressure, and this was because no one could get his

[00:17:24]

 blood pressure under control, so I decided to check an aldosterone level on him, and

[00:17:28]

 his aldosterone level was through the roof.

[00:17:30]

 He ended up having an aldosterone-secreting tumor in his adrenal gland, so he had primary

[00:17:35]

 hyperaldosteronism caused by a tumor in his adrenal gland, and when that was removed,

[00:17:41]

 his blood pressure got significantly better.

[00:17:42]

 We later found out that he also had a prolactin-secreting adenoma in his brain, in his pituitary

[00:17:49]

 gland, so he probably had some derivative of a multiple endocrine neoplasia, another

[00:17:54]

 zebra thing that medical students like, but this gentleman's blood pressure was never

[00:17:59]

 going to get better, no matter what we did, unless we removed the tumor that was secreting

[00:18:04]

 excess aldosterone into his blood.

[00:18:06]

 I'll talk about the aldosterone pathway within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade

[00:18:13]

 later in this podcast, but essentially, aldosterone is a hormone that works on the kidney to conserve

[00:18:18]

 sodium and causes the excretion of potassium.

[00:18:21]

 Now, if your hormones are overacting, and you're conserving tons of sodium, you will

[00:18:25]

 have hypertension, not because of excess sodium in the diet, but simply because you are increasing

[00:18:32]

 your absorption of sodium at the level of the kidney.

[00:18:35]

 So let's turn our attention back to primary hypertension.

[00:18:38]

 The rest of this podcast will be focused on primary hypertension, because I think of primary

[00:18:42]

 hypertension, colloquial hypertension, as a chronic, reversible illness with diet and

[00:18:49]

 lifestyle.

[00:18:50]

 Now, what does the Mayo Clinic say about primary hypertension?

[00:18:54]

 I'm showing you this to illustrate what mainstream Western medicine does for this condition.

[00:18:59]

 There is a top number of systolic pressure, a diastolic pressure.

[00:19:03]

 They talk about what is hypertension.

[00:19:04]

 Anything over 120 over 80 is really hypertension at this point.

[00:19:08]

 You should not have blood pressure of 120 over 80.

[00:19:12]

 And if you look at the Mayo Clinic, they do break this down into primary and secondary

[00:19:17]

 hypertension, with secondary hypertension having the potential causes that I mentioned

[00:19:22]

 earlier, though they do add obstructive sleep apnea, which I think is a good thing to be

[00:19:25]

 aware of.

[00:19:26]

 But risk factors for primary hypertension, according to the Mayo Clinic, include age.

[00:19:31]

 I'll comment on that in a moment.

[00:19:32]

 Race.

[00:19:32]

 There is some predilection of certain races to develop hypertension earlier than it does

[00:19:39]

 in Caucasians, specifically African-Americans develop hypertension more severely and at

[00:19:44]

 an earlier age than Caucasians.

[00:19:47]

 Family history is a risk factor for high blood pressure.

[00:19:49]

 Again, I am going to comment on that in a moment.

[00:19:52]

 Being overweight or obese.

[00:19:54]

 Yeah, I would agree with that.

[00:19:55]

 Not being physically active, probably, though I think that, as I've spoken about in the

[00:19:59]

 past, if you correct your diet and it is evolutionarily appropriate, you will want to be physically

[00:20:03]

 active because you will feel good.

[00:20:05]

 Tobacco can do it.

[00:20:06]

 Yes.

[00:20:07]

 Too much salt in your diet.

[00:20:08]

 I disagree with this one.

[00:20:09]

 I don't think salt is a root cause of hypertension, though excess salt in the diet can worsen

[00:20:15]

 hypertension once you have it.

[00:20:16]

 But I'll talk about sodium, why I don't think removing salt corrects the root cause of

[00:20:20]

 hypertension later in this podcast.

[00:20:22]

 Too little potassium in your diet.

[00:20:23]

 Again, I doubt this is a root cause for many people, though in conditions that I've spoken

[00:20:29]

 about later, specifically insulin resistance, that are at the root of hypertension, there

[00:20:34]

 is a hormonal milieu that can lead to excess sodium and lower amounts of potassium in the

[00:20:39]

 diet.

[00:20:39]

 People always ask about potassium on a carnivore diet.

[00:20:43]

 Something I've spoken about in the past is that meat has a good amount of potassium,

[00:20:47]

 and it's not about how much potassium you get in your diet alone.

[00:20:50]

 It's also about how much potassium you retain.

[00:20:53]

 There's plenty of potassium in fruit.

[00:20:54]

 Anyone on an animal-based diet, which is what I am more a fan of, will be getting plenty

[00:20:58]

 of fruit and plenty of potassium in their diet.

[00:21:00]

 You don't need vegetables to get enough potassium, nor does excess potassium correct

[00:21:04]

 hypertension.

[00:21:05]

 You must correct the root cause.

[00:21:07]

 Mayo Clinic says drinking too much alcohol.

[00:21:09]

 Yes, that can do it.

[00:21:10]

 Stress can do it, but it's only temporary, and the blood pressure should return to normal.

[00:21:14]

 Certain chronic conditions, they say kidney disease, diabetes, and sleep apnea, those

[00:21:19]

 are really correctable conditions.

[00:21:20]

 Those are considered mostly secondary hypertensive conditions.

[00:21:24]

 So what about age and family history?

[00:21:26]

 To me, this is really a cop-out within Western medicine.

[00:21:30]

 This is the type of thing that we are taught in medical school.

[00:21:33]

 As I said, we are taught that as you age, for every decade that you age, blood pressure

[00:21:38]

 increases, systolic blood pressure specifically, and many people will say, I have a family

[00:21:43]

 history of high blood pressure.

[00:21:45]

 I was told by my doctor there's nothing I can do.

[00:21:47]

 Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

[00:21:49]

 I believe both.

[00:00:00]

 told by my doctor there's nothing I can do. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I believe

[00:00:04]

 both of those are cop-outs by Western medicine. In many people who have a

[00:00:08]

 history of high blood pressure, high blood pressure will develop. But this is

[00:00:13]

 not because of the family history. The family history is perhaps a

[00:00:16]

 predisposition that can manifest if these individuals are not living in an

[00:00:22]

 evolutionarily consistent way. But a family history of hypertension,

[00:00:27]

 cardiovascular disease, that is atherosclerosis, heart disease, dementia,

[00:00:31]

 stroke, cancers, these are not for sure in humans. These are simply

[00:00:35]

 predispositions that we have that are then manifest by the way that we live

[00:00:40]

 our lives. Western medicine fails to teach medical students this and all too

[00:00:44]

 often I have heard from patients in the past that there's nothing I can do about

[00:00:48]

 my high blood pressure because it's in my family history. There's nothing I can

[00:00:51]

 do about my high cholesterol. I have a family history or I have high

[00:00:55]

 cholesterol. I have high blood pressure because I'm getting older. No, no, no. You

[00:01:00]

 do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol because you are getting

[00:01:04]

 older. You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol because you are living

[00:01:08]

 in an evolutionarily inconsistent way and Western medicine fails to realize

[00:01:13]

 this. And Western medicine fails to counsel patients that this is actually a

[00:01:17]

 correctable, reversible condition. When patients go to their doctors and they

[00:01:22]

 are diagnosed with primary hypertension, 99% of the time I believe they are told

[00:01:27]

 there is no cure for this. We don't know what causes it. There is nothing you can

[00:01:31]

 do about this. Take this medication. 1% of the time perhaps, maybe 5% of the time

[00:01:36]

 if we're generous, physicians will say cut down on certain foods in your diet.

[00:01:40]

 They will often recommend lower salt but as I've mentioned and as I will

[00:01:43]

 elaborate on later in this podcast, that doesn't correct through a cause and it

[00:01:46]

 causes more problems for many of these individuals. This paper should be shown

[00:01:51]

 to every single medical student across the United States, across the world.

[00:01:55]

 Title is The Physical Activity Patterns and Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease

[00:01:59]

 Risk in Hunter-Gatherers. Herman Ponser is one of the authors on this paper. He

[00:02:02]

 was on the podcast previously and they say in the abstract, we found no evidence

[00:02:08]

 of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this population of Hadza

[00:02:11]

 hunter-gatherers. There was a low prevalence of hypertension across the

[00:02:15]

 lifespan. Optimal levels for biomarkers of cardiovascular health. I've spoken

[00:02:20]

 about this paper in the past when I've illustrated the notion that hunter-

[00:02:24]

 gatherers do not get chronic illness. They do not have risk factors for

[00:02:27]

 cardiovascular disease as they age as do people in the Western world but the most

[00:02:33]

 important point I will make about this paper in this podcast is this graphic

[00:02:37]

 which shows the systolic blood pressure in men and women and the diastolic blood

[00:02:42]

 pressure in men and women across the lifespan. You can see here that on the

[00:02:47]

 x-axis is age in years and it goes up to 80 plus years old. Yes, hunter-gatherers

[00:02:53]

 live long, ripe, vital lives and our notion that they die early is confounded by

[00:02:59]

 higher rates of infant mortality in wild human populations and as you can see the

[00:03:05]

 systolic blood pressure does not rise in any significant amount as they age. Even

[00:03:10]

 into their eighth decade of life, the average systolic blood pressure was only

[00:03:14]

 slightly above 120 millimeters of mercury for the Hadza hunter-gatherers.

[00:03:19]

 Diastolic blood pressure remains between 60 and 80 millimeters of mercury across

[00:03:24]

 the lifespan well into the eighth decade of life for these Hadza hunter-gatherers.

[00:03:29]

 There is no age-related increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in

[00:03:34]

 wild living humans, that is hunter-gatherers, the Hadza. I visited the

[00:03:38]

 Hadza in February of 2021. I spent time with them. I've spoken about my

[00:03:42]

 experiences there and their diets at length in the past on this podcast. In

[00:03:46]

 summary, animals are what they dream about. It is what they think about all

[00:03:51]

 the time. They are hunters. They celebrate meat and organs like nothing else. They

[00:03:56]

 don't give a shit about vegetables. They really won't eat vegetables unless

[00:04:01]

 they're starving. They do not eat the baobab seeds unless they're starving.

[00:04:04]

 They will eat occasional tubers but they get excited about honey and fruit but

[00:04:09]

 even more so they get excited about meat and organs and they have no seed

[00:04:12]

 oils in their diet from their natural state. They are being influenced by local

[00:04:16]

 missionaries who provide them with cornmeal, unfortunately, and some seed

[00:04:19]

 oils. So trappings of Western civilization are creeping into their

[00:04:23]

 diets but they are not a significant part of their diet and I believe they

[00:04:27]

 were even less a part of their diet when Herman Ponser and his associates did

[00:04:30]

 this research on their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. So systolic and

[00:04:34]

 diastolic blood pressure do not rise with age in free-living wild human

[00:04:41]

 populations. This notion should be taught to all medical students as should the

[00:04:46]

 notion that free-living humans do not suffer rates of diabetes, obesity, chronic

[00:04:53]

 age-related illness, cardiovascular disease, dementia, or cancer that are even

[00:04:57]

 a fraction of what we do in the West. Freedom from all of these things is

[00:05:01]

 completely possible if we align our diet and lifestyle with what our human

[00:05:06]

 body is expecting. That's the work that I do. That's how I frame all of the work I

[00:05:10]

 do. Let's return back to the conversation of hypertension. How many patients who go

[00:05:15]

 to their doctors receive counseling about dietary and lifestyle changes for

[00:05:19]

 hypertension? I would say very few. Some perhaps. Again, the majority of this is

[00:05:24]

 limited to salt restriction which I am not a fan of. Furthermore, we must be

[00:05:29]

 honest with ourselves about the health of our doctors. From a 2007 study, 50% of

[00:05:35]

 male physicians in the United States, this is the Physicians Health Study, were

[00:05:39]

 obese and overweight. Those are two different BMI categories that I'm

[00:05:43]

 combining. But obesity and overweight were 50% of U.S. male physicians. In the

[00:05:49]

 Nurses Health Study, 39% of nurses were obese and overweight. And we know that in

[00:05:57]

 an obese physician and likely in an obese or overweight nurse, counseling

[00:06:01]

 regarding dietary and lifestyle changes will be very different, if present at all.

[00:06:06]

 There is good research to corroborate this notion. You can see here a very sad

[00:06:10]

 study that is unfortunately true from 2012. The Impact of Physician Body Mass

[00:06:16]

 Index on Obesity Care and Beliefs. This is using a national cross-country survey

[00:06:21]

 of 500 primary care physicians from 2011. We found that physicians with

[00:06:26]

 normal BMI were more likely to engage their obese patients in weight loss

[00:06:30]

 discussions as compared to overweight and obese physicians. 30% versus 18% with

[00:06:35]

 a p-value of 0.01. Physicians with a normal BMI had greater confidence in

[00:06:40]

 their ability to provide dietary and exercise counseling to their obese

[00:06:44]

 patients. A higher percentage of normal BMI physicians believed that overweight

[00:06:49]

 and obese patients would be less likely to trust weight loss advice from

[00:06:53]

 overweight and obese doctors. And physicians in the normal BMI category

[00:06:57]

 were more likely to believe that physicians should model healthy weight

[00:07:00]

 related behaviors, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly. The

[00:07:04]

 probability of a physician recording an obesity diagnosis or initiating a weight

[00:07:10]

 loss conversation with their obese patients was higher when the perception

[00:07:14]

 of the patient's body weight met or exceeded their own personal body weight.

[00:07:19]

 And those numbers are substantial. So the probability of a physician recording an

[00:07:24]

 obesity diagnosis was 93% versus 7% and 89% versus 11% for the

[00:07:33]

 probability of initiating a weight loss conversation when the obese patient's

[00:07:38]

 body mass index was greater than the physicians. So if the patient was not

[00:07:44]

 fatter than the physician, the doctors didn't talk to them about weight loss

[00:07:48]

 and why would they even if the patient was overweight clearly. These results

[00:07:53]

 suggest that more normal weight physicians provided recommended obesity

[00:07:57]

 care to their patients and felt confident doing so. Yeah, no surprise there. But

[00:08:03]

 interestingly, I have had conversations with many friends from medical school,

[00:08:07]

 from residency, and friends who are currently residents. And this is just my

[00:08:12]

 observation, but they will often tell me, dependent on specialties, most of their

[00:08:17]

 colleagues, even in residency, are drinking, they're overweight, they're not eating

[00:08:22]

 healthfully. We're not creating a future cadre of physicians who value health.

[00:08:27]

 We're creating physicians who value work, who value money, and who value getting

[00:08:33]

 the heck out of the hospital most of the time. So I believe the medical system is

[00:08:37]

 massively broken and statistics suggesting that half of all male

[00:08:41]

 physicians are obese and overweight. I can't even imagine how many male

[00:08:46]

 physicians, or female physicians for that matter, have elevated levels of fasting

[00:08:49]

 insulin. We are not creating a group of healthy doctors, so how could we be

[00:08:54]

 expected to counsel patients properly regarding the most important things that

[00:08:59]

 they can do for their health? Dietary changes, aligning their diet with what is

[00:09:03]

 evolutionarily consistent for humans, and lifestyle changes. Exercising more

[00:09:08]

 sunlight, avoidance of toxins in the environment, clean drinking water, etc. So

[00:09:13]

 now that we've talked about the background of hypertension, the

[00:09:17]

 differences between primary and secondary hypertension, how Western

[00:09:21]

 medicine thinks about primary hypertension, age-related family history,

[00:09:26]

 irreversible, let's talk about how Western medicine addresses hypertension,

[00:09:30]

 mostly medications. Salt restriction is part of it, I'll talk about that in a

[00:09:35]

 moment, but the medications that Western medicine uses for hypertension include

[00:09:39]

 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct

[00:09:44]

 renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, diuretics like

[00:09:49]

 thiazides or loop diuretics. I'll talk about the ACE, ARB, and direct renin

[00:09:55]

 inhibitors in the context of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which

[00:09:58]

 I'll detail in a moment. But none of those medications correct the root cause

[00:10:02]

 of hypertension, which I believe most of medicine agrees on, and we know very

[00:10:07]

 clearly. Do we have a medication that treats the root cause of hypertension? We

[00:10:11]

 do, actually. I'm not a fan of using it, and I'll talk about that later in the

[00:10:14]

 podcast. I'm going to keep you guys in suspense for a little bit longer, but

[00:10:17]

 that medication doesn't do great things for humans as it's correcting the root

[00:10:22]

 cause, but we have a medication that corrects the root cause of hypertension.

[00:10:26]

 I'm not advocating that we use it. I only will bring it up later in the

[00:10:29]

 podcast to illustrate the cause of hypertension, how correcting the cause of

[00:10:34]

 hypertension can reverse other issues and be beneficial, and how insulin

[00:10:40]

 resistance can be fixed. So stay tuned for all of that. So what are the side

[00:10:44]

 effects of the medications we use to treat hypertension? Well, if you're on a

[00:10:46]

 beta blocker, it's going to slow your pulse. It causes erectile dysfunction. It

[00:10:50]

 can cause depression. Calcium channel blockers cause peripheral edema,

[00:10:54]

 worsening of swelling in the limbs, and that can cause orthostasis or

[00:10:58]

 lightheadedness when people stand up, leading to falls and orthopedic injuries.

[00:11:02]

 Diuretics, whether they're loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics, cause

[00:11:05]

 loss of critical electrolytes for humans and nutrients that are not intended to

[00:11:10]

 be lost. Look at the list of nutrient deficiencies associated with a loop

[00:11:14]

 diuretic like Lasix or furosemide. It is long. B vitamins, magnesium, other

[00:11:19]

 minerals, massive deficiencies follow when we cause diuresis in humans to

[00:11:25]

 treat hypertension without treating the root cause. Thiazide diuretics can also

[00:11:29]

 cause problems in terms of electrolyte deficiencies and nutrient deficiencies.

[00:11:33]

 These are a nightmare for our human long term health. This is the problem with

[00:11:37]

 Western medicine. It's myopic. It looks at a symptom, treats the symptom, and

[00:11:41]

 then ignores the side effects of the medication or must use other medications

[00:11:45]

 to treat the side effects of the medication it uses. Why not just treat

[00:11:49]

 the root cause? Angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, direct

[00:11:53]

 front end inhibitors, all can cause electrolyte issues. Many of them can

[00:11:56]

 cause angioedema. ACE inhibitors specifically cause a dry cough associated

[00:12:00]

 with bradykinin. None of these medications are ideal for humans. No

[00:12:04]

 medication that we give to humans is ideal in general. They all have utility.

[00:12:07]

 Have I prescribed all of them in the past? Yes, absolutely. I have. I was once

[00:12:13]

 a physician assistant who worked in cardiology, who did not understand the

[00:12:16]

 root cause of hypertension, and so I prescribed all these medications. I have

[00:12:19]

 also prescribed statins to patients in the past. Would I do this now? No, I

[00:12:23]

 would strongly counsel patients regarding the root causes of hypertension,

[00:12:28]

 which I believe are insulin resistance, and I'll get to that in a moment, and

[00:12:31]

 how to change that. I will definitely talk about that in this podcast. For the

[00:12:34]

 sake of completeness, I've spoken about the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

[00:12:38]

 a number of times in this podcast. I will do a little bit of education about

[00:12:41]

 what this is. In the liver, there is a substance produced called angiotensinogen

[00:12:46]

 that is converted to angiotensin 1 by a substance called renin, which is

[00:12:52]

 produced by the kidneys. Renin will be released from the kidneys if the

[00:12:56]

 kidneys sense that blood pressure is low in a number of ways, at the level of

[00:13:01]

 arterioles, at the level of something called the JGA or the juxtaglomerular

[00:13:05]

 apparatus. Angiotensin 1 is converted to a more active form, angiotensin 2, by

[00:13:11]

 an enzyme called ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme, found in the

[00:13:15]

 pulmonary and renal endothelium. Angiotensin 2 has many effects on the
