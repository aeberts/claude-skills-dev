Please help create a skill that can transcribe the audio of a podcast into a readable markdown file identifying the speakers using local scripts. 

To Discuss:

Which Libraries to use for audio -> text transcription?

Which libraries should we use for diarization?

Question: Should we use Torch?

Question: Which Torch library to install for my Mac M1 with 32GB of ram?

`uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # for GPU
# or
`uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu  # for CPU

In the resources folder of the current working directory are some test files to use:
- audio recording: Paul Saladino MD 181 How to Reverse High Blood Pressure.mp3
- example_wall_of_text.txt -> an unreadable "wall of text" that can be used to test any created scripts for formatting. 

I have an OpenAI API key saved in the file: OPENAI_API_KEY.txt

CLAUDE Response:

⏺ Excellent! Let's create a podcast transcription skill. Before we build it, let me help you make the right technical choices for your Mac M1.

  Technical Recommendations for Mac M1 (32GB RAM)

  Audio Transcription

  I recommend OpenAI's Whisper API since you already have an API key:
  - Pros: Fast, accurate, no local compute needed, handles multiple languages
  - Alternative: Local Whisper (openai-whisper) - free but slower on M1

  Speaker Diarization

  pyannote.audio is the industry standard:
  - Best open-source diarization library
  - Good accuracy for speaker identification
  - Requires PyTorch

  PyTorch for Mac M1

  Important: For M1 Macs, use the standard install with MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) support:
  uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
  Don't use the CUDA (cu121) or CPU-only versions you mentioned - those are for NVIDIA GPUs or CPU-only systems. The default install automatically uses Apple's Metal
  acceleration on M1.

  ---
  My recommendation: Use OpenAI Whisper API for transcription + pyannote.audio for diarization. This gives you the best balance of speed and accuracy.

  Does this approach work for you, or would you prefer to use local Whisper to avoid API costs?

Follow up questions:

Audio compression target: What audio quality/bitrate should we target for compression? For Whisper transcription, we could go quite low (e.g., 16kHz mono, 64kbps) while maintaining intelligibility. Should I aim for aggressive compression to stay well under the 25MB limit per chunk, or more conservative?

- For the audio compression target let's go with 16kHz stereo, 128kbps

Chunk strategy: For splitting audio into chunks:
- Let's try creating chunks based on a fixed size target i.e. aim for 20MB chunks to stay under 25MB. 
- Question: Is there any way to ensure that we're creating chunks that end after a word or sentence to avoid cutting a chunk in the middle of a word?
- If we leave the chunk sized fixed (i.e. 20MB) maybe we should start the next chunk at 20MB minus a few KB so that we have slightly "overlapping" chunks. This avoids the problem of cutting off a word in the middle but now we need to consider how we merge the chunks so that the overlaps are not repeated. Please give me your thoughts on managing this issue. 


Temporary file management: Should the script:
Automatically clean up the compressed audio and chunks after successful transcription?
Keep them for debugging purposes?
Make this configurable via a flag?

- Let's make this configurable via a flag. The default should be to create a subfolder with the "working copies" of chunks and, if necessary, raw transcription files. This will also be useful if the process is interrupted mid way through.


Diarization approach for chunks: For speaker diarization across multiple chunks, should we:

Option A: Run diarization on each chunk independently (faster, but may have inconsistent speaker labels across chunks - Speaker 1 in chunk 1 might be labeled differently in chunk 2)
Option B: Run diarization on the full compressed audio file once (slower, but maintains consistent speaker labels across all chunks)
Option C: Run diarization per chunk and then use speaker embedding matching to align speaker IDs across chunks (most accurate but more complex)

- Good question, I don't know if there's a size limit on the diarization api so it's unclear what the constraints are. Let's start with option B: run diarization on the full compressed audio file because its simpler and most consistent (I'm less worried about speed).

Timestamp handling: 
- Timestamps in the final transcript should reflect the absolute time from the start of the original audio file (easier to reference back to original) - it's more complicated but relative timestamps are not very helpful because I'll be referring back to the original audio if I have questions.

Error handling: If one chunk fails to transcribe, should the script:
- During the debugging phase, if one chunk fails the script should fail completely and report the error giving as much information as possible for debugging.


Thank you for the detailed answers! I have one follow-up question about the chunk overlapping strategy: Chunk Overlap & Merging Strategy: You mentioned creating overlapping chunks (e.g., chunk 2 starts a few KB before chunk 1 ends) to avoid cutting words mid-way. For merging these overlapping transcriptions, I see a few approaches: Option A: Timestamp-based deduplication
Use the absolute timestamps from Whisper to identify the overlapping region
Keep transcription from the first chunk up to the overlap point, then seamlessly continue with the second chunk
Pro: Clean, deterministic
Con: Requires precise timestamp alignment
Option B: Text similarity matching
Compare the end of chunk N with the beginning of chunk N+1 to find matching text
Trim the duplicate portion based on longest common substring
Pro: More robust to timestamp drift
Con: Slightly more complex logic, potential for edge cases
Option C: Sentence boundary detection in overlap region
In the overlap region, find complete sentences
Choose a clean sentence boundary as the merge point
Pro: Most natural reading experience, no partial sentences
Con: Most complex, requires sentence detection
My recommendation would be Option A (timestamp-based) as the primary strategy with Option C (sentence boundary) as a refinement - i.e., use timestamps to identify the overlap region, then look for a sentence boundary near that point for a clean merge. Additionally, regarding the overlap size: would 5 seconds of audio overlap be reasonable? This should be enough to ensure we don't cut words while not creating excessive redundancy. Does this approach sound good, or would you prefer a different merging strategy?

Let's go with Option A - timestamp based deduplication. I'm not clear how timestamps are assigned so it's difficult to determine if a 5 second overlap is reasonable. Can you explore the code and identify how timestamps are assigned and we can determine the optimal overlap?

# Error

Running the "podcast transcriber" Claude skill from this repo on a large, 70 min, audio file resulted in an error (the error was unfortunately truncated):
 
 ⎿  Processing: Paul Saladino MD 181 How to Reverse High Blood Pressure.mp3
     Output will be saved to: Paul Saladino MD 181 How to Reverse High Blood Pressure.md
     … +64 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "/Users/zand/.claude/skills/podcast-transcriber/scripts/transcribe_podcast.py", line 641, in <module>
         main()

Here is a summary of the problem:

Script failed on Diarization:

  The podcast transcription script successfully:
  - ✓ Compressed the 162MB audio file to 65MB
  - ✓ Split into 4 chunks (to stay under the 25MB Whisper API limit)
  - ✓ Transcribed all 4 chunks via OpenAI Whisper API
  - ✓ Merged the transcripts with deduplication (1859 words from 70-minute podcast)

  The Failure

  The speaker diarization step (using pyannote.audio) failed with this error:

  ValueError: requested chunk [ 00:00:00.000 -->  00:00:10.000] from compressed_audio file resulted in 158895 samples instead of the expected 160000 samples.

  Root Cause

  The pyannote pipeline is encountering a sample rate mismatch when processing the compressed audio file (compressed_audio.mp3 at 16kHz). This is likely due to:
  - Frame alignment issues during compression/resampling
  - The compressed file having slightly different sample counts than expected at 16kHz

  Current State

  - Transcript text exists but wasn't saved because the script failed before completion
  - Working files are preserved in: Paul Saladino MD 181 How to Reverse High Blood Pressure_chunks/
  - The diarization was attempting to use compressed_audio.mp3 (device: mps)

  Here is what I want to change or add.

  1. Fix the compression process - ensure exact sample alignment during resampling
  2. Add fallback option to allow script to save the transcript without diarization if diarization fails
  3. Add tests in the parent directory (i.e. transcribe-podcast) to test:
  - Test availability of all dependencies
  - Test sample counts on compressed audio file to ensure consistency
  - Any other tests you deem necessary


Improve readability.

Please implement the following plan to Improve Podcast Transcript Readability:

Changes to Implement
1. Reduce Timecode Frequency (30-second intervals instead of 3-second)
Group sentences into logical paragraphs
Add timecode only at paragraph/topic transitions
Format: ## [00:00:00] Topic Title for major sections
Format: **[00:05:30]** for paragraph-level timestamps within sections
2. Add Paragraph Structure
Combine related sentences into cohesive paragraphs
Use proper markdown paragraph spacing
Group by thought/topic, not arbitrary time breaks
3. Add Content Hierarchy
# Podcast Transcript
## Metadata (file, duration, speakers)
## Table of Contents (auto-generated from timestamps)
## [00:00:00] Introduction & Sponsors
## [00:08:16] Main Topic: Hypertension Overview
## [00:10:35] Current Burden of Hypertension
### [00:12:40] Global Epidemiology
## [00:14:18] Primary vs Secondary Hypertension
4. Create Speaker Placeholders (when diarization unavailable)
Format: **Speaker:** <paragraph text>
Or use **[Host/Guest]** if identifiable from context
Better than no indication at all
5. Add Navigation Features
Table of contents with clickable links to timestamps
Topic summaries for each major section
Key points or highlights
6. Format Example - Before vs After
BEFORE (current):
[00:00:00]

 You do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol

[00:00:03]

 because you are getting older.

[00:00:04]

 You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol
AFTER (proposed):
## [00:00:00] Opening Statement

**Speaker:** You do not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol because you are getting older. You have high blood pressure and high cholesterol because you are living in an evolutionarily inconsistent way and Western medicine fails to realize this.
7. Implementation
Modify format_transcript_without_diarization() function in transcribe_podcast.py
Add --paragraph-duration flag (default: 30 seconds)
Add --generate-toc flag for table of contents
Add --section-markers flag to auto-detect topic changes
Optional: Use AI to generate section headings from content
Files to Modify
transcribe_podcast.py - Update formatting functions
Add optional post-processing script for existing transcripts
Benefits
50x reduction in visual clutter (2,462 lines → ~50 sections)
Readable as continuous prose, not fragmented text
Easy navigation with TOC
Better for sharing, reading, and reference
